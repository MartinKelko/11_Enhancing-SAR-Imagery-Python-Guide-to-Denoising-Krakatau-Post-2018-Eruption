Enhancing Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery: A Python Guide to Denoising Krakatau’s Morphology Following the 2018 Major Eruption
Leveraging Python libraries for deepdespeckling to improve SAR data for volcanic analysis

Since SAR can penetrate through darkness, clouds, and rain, it proves effective in detecting environmental changes caused by natural or human-induced events like flooding, oil spills, deforestation, ship detection, and sea ice monitoring, among others. However, SAR images are often affected by speckle noise, which can obscure fine details and make interpretation challenging. To address this, various denoising techniques, including deepdespeckling, are employed.

Denoising and Deepdespeckling
Denoising is a general term for reducing noise in images, which can be achieved through various algorithms. Deepdespeckling specifically refers to advanced methods, often leveraging deep learning, to reduce speckle noise in SAR imagery. These techniques aim to preserve important features and details while minimizing noise, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the images.

The Challenge of Denoising SAR Images
The problem is that SAR images suffer from noise in their raw format. While these images are also usually heavy files, the task of denoising them efficiently appears to be both challenging from a scientific perspective and very useful in the real world. Efficient denoising techniques are essential for improving the usability of SAR data without excessively increasing processing time or computational resource requirements.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
SAR operates by emitting microwave signals towards a target area and capturing the reflected signals to construct an image. The “synthetic aperture” refers to the technique of combining multiple radar measurements to simulate a larger antenna, thereby achieving higher resolution than would be possible with a single radar pulse.

This article explores a Python-based approach to denoising the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) visualization of Anak Krakatau‘s morphology changes since 2018. The animation includes the pre-eruptive shape of the volcano before the massive eruption, which generated the deadly tsunami in December 2018. Dramatic changes to morphology have continued by forming a new cinder cone in the inner caldera and an extensive lava delta on the western slope of the edifice in May 2022.
Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan.

Using libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pillow, and Matplotlib, the provided code demonstrates a practical implementation of these techniques within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Understanding the Code
The goal of the code is to reduce the noise in the GIF time-lapse animation composed of SAR images by applying a denoising algorithm to each frame.

Loading and Extracting Frames: The code begins by loading a GIF containing SAR imagery. It uses the Pillow library to extract each frame and convert them into RGB format for further processing.

Denoising Function: A custom function, denoise_frame, is defined to apply denoising to a single frame. This function uses OpenCV to convert the image to the YUV color space, where the Y (luminance) channel is denoised using Non-Local Means Denoising. The denoised Y channel is then merged back with the U and V channels, and the image is converted back to RGB format.

Denoising All Frames: The denoise_frame function is applied to each frame extracted from the GIF. This results in a list of denoised frames.

Saving the Denoised GIF: The denoised frames are converted back to PIL images and saved as a new GIF. This step ensures the denoised imagery can be easily viewed and shared.

Displaying the Denoised GIF: To provide a clear view of the results, the code generates HTML to display the denoised GIF at an increased size.

Conclusion
The effective denoising of SAR imagery is crucial for the accurate analysis and interpretation of complex landscapes, such as the dynamic morphology of Anak Krakatau. By utilizing Python and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pillow, and Matplotlib, this approach offers a practical solution for reducing speckle noise and enhancing image quality. This method not only improves the usability of SAR data but also provides clearer insights into significant geological events, like the 2018 eruption and subsequent changes in Anak Krakatau. Efficient denoising techniques, as demonstrated, are essential for leveraging the full potential of SAR technology in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and other critical applications.
